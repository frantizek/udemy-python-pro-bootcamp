Day 1: Band Name Generator
100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp

Challenge:
Create a simple band name generator that:
1. Greets the user
2. Asks for the city they grew up in
3. Asks for the name of a pet
4. Combines them to show their band name

Example:
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
> New York
What's your pet's name?
> Rocket
Your band name could be New York Rocket

This exercise focuses on:
- Print statements
- Input functions
- String variables
- String concatenation
