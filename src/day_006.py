Day 6: Python Functions & Karel the Robot
100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp

Challenge:
Learn and practice Python functions by solving Karel the Robot problems.
Karel is an educational programming language that teaches fundamental
programming concepts through robot navigation.

In this exercise, you'll create functions to make Karel:
1. Move around a grid world
2. Turn left/right
3. Interact with beepers
4. Solve maze-like problems

Key Concepts:
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Code reusability
- Problem decomposition

Note: We'll simulate Karel's world using text-based representation
since we don't have the actual Karel environment.
